    Running the Application
    Start the Development Server:
    After installing the dependencies, start the development server by running:
        ### `npm start`
    This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start: Runs the app in the development mode. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser.
npm test: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
npm run eject: Removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies directly into the project.

Additional Notes
If you encounter any issues, ensure that your Node.js and npm installations are up to date.
The frontend is configured to connect to the backend API running at `http://localhost:5000`. Ensure the backend is running before using the frontend.
